# AngularJS-RockID-App-with-Bootstrap
Answer geological questions about your rock sample to identify the rock name. 

This project was created in order to become more acquainted with Javascript, Bootstrap, and the Angular framework.

The app could be used in a Geology 100 lab at a university in place of their text book as a way of classifying a rock sample by textural features and mineralogical composition to identify the rock name. And, with some basic geology knowledge, used by anyone in the field to identify a rock. The app html is dynamic and the css is colored to enhance contrast, all for the point of using the app under field conditions which would include bright sunlight and low data-service areas.

The geological information used in this app was borrowed from the Laboratory Manual in Physical Geology 9th ed. by the American Geological Institute.
